In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between `NSDecimalNumber` and string representations of numbers.  If a string containing a number with excessive precision (many decimal places) is used to initialize an `NSDecimalNumber`, the resulting object might not behave as expected in calculations.  Rounding errors can accumulate silently, leading to unexpected results in financial or scientific applications.

For example:

```objectivec
NSString *preciseString = @"123.4567890123456789";
NSDecimalNumber *decimalNumber = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:preciseString];
NSDecimalNumber *result = [decimalNumber decimalNumberByAdding:[NSDecimalNumber one]];
NSLog(@"Result: %@
", result);
```

This seemingly simple addition might produce a slightly inaccurate result due to the internal representation limitations of `NSDecimalNumber` when handling a string with high precision. The difference might be minuscule, but in sensitive calculations, it can accumulate and cause significant errors.
